# Small List Utilities

Simple Python script with multiple small list and string utilities.

Usage:

```bash
python main.py
```

This repository contains a small Python script (`main.py`) with short
examples of list and tuple comprehensions, simple string utilities, and
basic number operations. The script prints example outputs for each
task so you can quickly inspect results.

Usage
-----
Run the script with your system Python:

```powershell
python main.py
```

Examples printed by the script
----------------------------
- Squares of even numbers (1..20)
- Numbers divisible by 3 (1..50)
- Lengths of sample words
- Digit-sum filters, prime lists, palindromic numbers
- Tuple comprehension examples

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or newer

If you want this project organized as a package, or prefer the examples
returned as functions instead of printed output, tell me and I will
refactor `main.py` accordingly.
